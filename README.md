# Ecommerce-Follow-Along

## Project Description

The *Ecommerce Follow Along* project is designed to help developers build a full-stack e-commerce web application using the *MERN stack* (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). This project follows a hands-on approach, where you will learn and implement key concepts such as *user authentication, **product management, and **order handling* through *RESTful APIs*. By the end of the project, you will have built a functioning e-commerce platform with core features, using JavaScript across both the client and server side.

The MERN stack allows for a seamless and efficient development process, providing a unified language (JavaScript) for the entire stack, making it easier for developers to build, scale, and maintain web applications.

## Milestone 1: Project Overview

In this milestone, we introduced the foundations of building a full-stack e-commerce application using the MERN stack. Key topics covered include:

### 1. *Overview of the MERN Stack*
   - The *MERN* stack is a popular set of technologies used for building modern, scalable, and fast web applications. The stack consists of:
     - *MongoDB* (database)
     - *Express.js* (backend framework)
     - *React.js* (frontend library)
     - *Node.js* (JavaScript runtime)
   - The key advantage of MERN is its *JavaScript-only* approach, where both the front-end and back-end are built using JavaScript, making development easier and more efficient.

### 2. *REST API Structure and Endpoints*
   - We explored *REST APIs* (Representational State Transfer) and their role in allowing communication between the client and server.
   - Key API endpoints were introduced to handle:
     - *User Authentication*: Register and log in users with secure authentication.
     - *Product Management*: Add, update, and retrieve product data.
     - *Order Handling*: Manage customer orders from creation to checkout.
   - These APIs interact with the database, responding with data in JSON format.

### 3. *Basics of Database Schema Design*
   - In MongoDB, *schema design* involves defining the structure of data stored in the database, including relationships between different collections such as *users, **products, and **orders*.
   - The schema plays a critical role in ensuring data consistency and making it easier to query.

### 4. *Role of Authentication in Web Applications*
   - Authentication verifies the identity of a user before granting access to certain features or data.
   - In this project, we focused on building *secure authentication* mechanisms, allowing users to register, log in, and manage their orders.
   - We implemented techniques like *JWT (JSON Web Tokens)* to securely handle user sessions.

## Features Implemented

- *User Authentication*:
  - Sign up and login features using JWT for secure sessions.
  
- *Product Management*:
  - Add, update, and view products within the e-commerce platform.

- *Order Management*:
  - Create, update, and view customer orders.

## Milestone 2: Frontend Setup (Login Page)

In this milestone, the Login Page was built using React’s CRA. For an improved interface, Tailwind CSS was integrated for styling and React-Icons for visual enhancements. Tailwind’s utility-first approach ensures a responsive and modern design.

The Login Page includes fields for email and password, form validation, state management, and error handling. Icons enhance usability and the overall experience.

## Milestone 3: Backend Setup and Project Structure

We established the foundational structure for the backend as follows:

- *src/ Directory:* Contains server-side source files.
  - *config/*: Holds environment configuration like MongoDB URL and port.
  - *controllers/*: Handles request logic for different routes.
  - *database/*: Connects to MongoDB via db.js.
  - *middleware/*: Contains custom middleware like centralized error handling.
  - *models/*: Defines Mongoose schemas.
  - *routes/*: Sets up API endpoints.
  - *utils/*: Includes helper functions like ErrorHandler.js.

The *index.js* file sets up the Express app, basic routing, and server listener.

## Milestone 4: User Model, Controller, and Multer Integration

We created the User Model and its controller, then integrated Multer for handling file uploads.

---

## Milestone 5: Missing Number Task (Small Task)

This milestone focused on solving the missing number problem in an array.

---

## Milestone 6: Password Encryption and User Data Storage

- Password Hashing: Implemented bcrypt to encrypt passwords during signup, storing only hashed versions in the database.
- User Data Management: Ensured all user information (like name and email) is stored securely, with password encryption maintained throughout.

---

## Milestone 7: Login Endpoint Development

- User Authentication: The endpoint accepts user credentials, retrieves user data, and verifies the password using bcrypt.
- Password Validation: Hashed passwords are compared for secure authentication.

---

## Milestone 8: Product Display Components

Two React components were created:
- Home.jsx: Displays the product list.
- ProductCard.jsx: Acts as a template for individual product information.

Products are dynamically mapped and displayed based on database content.

---

## Milestone 9: Product Form Creation

- Frontend Form: A user-friendly form to input product details like name, price, description, category, and images.
- Form File: Created ProductForm.jsx for data collection and validation.

---

## Milestone 10: Product Schema and API Integration

- Schema: Defined ProductModel.js using Mongoose.
- API: Developed an endpoint to handle POST requests for adding product data to MongoDB.
- File Upload: Utilized Multer middleware for image handling.

---

## Milestone 11 & 12: Frontend-Backend Integration

- Data Fetching: Updated Products.js to retrieve product data from MongoDB and pass it to Home.jsx.
- Form Submission: Enhanced the product form to send data to the database.

---

## Milestone 13: Product Update Feature

- Edit Functionality: Created an endpoint to update product data with a PUT request.
- Frontend Enhancements: Added edit and delete buttons, with role-based visibility for sellers.

---

## Milestone 14: Product Deletion and Bug Fixes

- Delete Feature: Implemented an endpoint to delete products by ID.
- Bug Fixes: Resolved unexpected behavior and optimized routing.

...

## Milestone 15: Navigation Bar Implementation

Navbar Creation: Developed a persistent navigation bar that appears on all pages, enhancing user navigation.
NavLinks Added: Included links to Home, Product Form, Login, and Sign Up pages for easy access.
Styling: Utilized Tailwind CSS to ensure a responsive and visually appealing design.

## Milestone 16: Single Product Detail Page

SingleProduct.jsx: Developed a dedicated page to display detailed information about individual products.
Routing: Configured routes to navigate to the Single Product page from the product listings.
Enhancements: Made minor adjustments to improve user experience across the site.

## Milestone 17 & 18: Cart Functionality Development

Cart Schema: Extended the existing schema to include cart details for each user.
Post Request: Created an endpoint to handle adding products to the user's cart and storing them in the database.
Multer Integration: Ensured image uploads function correctly within the cart system.

---

## Milestone 19: Cart Page & Quantity Management

In this milestone, we built the cart page for our e-commerce app.  
- Displayed products inside the cart using the existing backend API.  
- Added + and - buttons to increase and decrease product quantity.  
- Created backend endpoints to handle quantity updates.  
- Connected frontend buttons with the backend API for real-time updates.

---

## *Milestone 20 - User Profile Endpoint *

- Implemented the /profile endpoint to fetch user data and store it in an object. 
- Created profile.jsx to dynamically display all user details.  
- Ensured proper data handling and integration between frontend and backend.
- Planned future improvements like profile editing, authentication, and UI enhancements.
